						<div id="text">I have been involved with technology since I first got my hands on a computer when I was eight years old. Since then I have actively kept up with as much technology as I can handle. Outside of the world of coding I am an avid gamer. I am both a console owner and PC user, ranging from Xbox 1 to Nitendo Switch to League of Legends. Taking another step away from computers comes my passion for sports. I grew up playing sports, but in the end fell in love with soccer. Barcelona is my spanish team while across the sea, Manchester United holds my EPL card. Rock climbing is a hobby I took up last year and have enoyed it tremednously. It is a sport in which puzzle solving is at its finest, it is you against the wall and there is a solution, you just need to find it. Traveling is another trait of me, the desire to experience new culture and be immeresed in a new environment ranging from langauge, architecture, land, climate, art, people, and food. After relocating to Washington D.C. area I fell in love with cycling leading to a 80lb weight loss as well as the need to bike all the roads. The best part of exploring new areas are the foods you discover and want to return to or recreate in your home. I consider myself a foodie and a chef because I love to cook and eat. I try to teach myself at least one new recipe every three weeks so my cookbook and palette grows. Hand in hand with a new recipe, I try to go to a new restaurant once a month to learn about the chef's style and to experience new delicious foods.
